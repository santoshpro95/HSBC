  Money has a tendency to lose its value over time because the price of goods and services has an upward tendency. This is called inflation. Here are some factors that could eat away your money: 

Inflation. Simply, inflation occurs when the price of goods and services rises. And when prices rise, people will ask for a rise in salary. That's why the money you earn today will be worth less 10 years from now. 

Interest rate fluctuations. A drop in interest rates means a smaller return on your deposits, and if the interest rate is lower than the rate of inflation, your savings lose value. But for some investments, such as equities and bonds, the value of your investment may rise because of the drop in interest rates. 

  

Therefore it is crucial that you have a financial plan to protect your future and to put your money where it generates reasonable returns to meet your needs. 

ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance. ESG and sustainability factors influence a wide range of industries from agricultural, industrial, consumption, technology to medical sectors as these factors are closely connected to social policies, economic development and individual lives.
